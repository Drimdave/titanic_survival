# Titanic Survival
*Udacity - Machine learning Nano Degree Program : Project-0*

## Project Overview
*This is first project in the series of the projects listed in Udacity- Machine Learning Nano Degree Program.*

*In this optional project, I have created decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. I started with a simple algorithm and increased its complexity until i was able to accurately predict the outcomes for **80.13% of the passengers** in the provided data.*

In addition, there are **two Python libraries:**
* numpy and
* pandas

that i have used in this project
